Sani Hand
========

This is the Django back-end to a 48hr Hackathon, with the goal of making an innovative project using ibeacons.

The Problem
====

Doctors must wash their hands before each patient consulation. This is hugely important, and doctors (and their faculties) 
can be penalized vast fines if they don't comply. Worse, they can pass on MRSA and worse infections.

This application provides a solution to this problem using ibeacons, gamification and a mobile app. 

Result
====

We produced a compelling pitch, a mobile app, a scoreboard & admin website, and we were pleased to have won the hackathon.
